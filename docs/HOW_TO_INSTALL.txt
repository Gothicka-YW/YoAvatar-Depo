YoAvatar Depo - Install Instructions (Prototype)

1. Get an ImgBB API key (https://api.imgbb.com/). Log in, copy your key.
2. In Chrome/Edge, open chrome://extensions (edge://extensions).
3. Toggle Developer Mode (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and choose the YoAvatar-Depo folder.
5. Open the extension popup; go to Settings tab, paste your API key, Save Key.
6. Upload tab: click or drop an image; choose / create a category; Upload.
7. After upload, click Copy Link to get forum-ready BBCode.

Troubleshooting:
- If uploads fail, open the popup DevTools (right-click popup → Inspect) and check console for network errors.
- Ensure key is valid and not rate-limited.
- Some large images may take longer to encode; keep popup open until status shows Uploaded.

Data:
- Avatars metadata currently stored locally (no cloud sync). Use Export in Settings for backup.
